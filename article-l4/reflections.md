You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
 
 **What new skills have you learned?**
 
 I have learned about some new tags like `<aside>`, `<time>` and some related attributes and also some theory behind why certain html tags are preferred over the other with real world examples from the helpful forum mentor.
  
 **What has been easy?**
 
 Building a basic html page in general has been very easy so far. 
 
 **What has been difficult?**
 
 With this basic example, it was important in understanding the importance of one tag over the other although they perform similarly in the browser.
 More than difficult, I would say, this was time consuming to grasp and understand.
 
 **How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?**
 
 I have used the skills I acquired from watching the videos and working on the quizzes in the previous lessons and most importantly googling issues when I get stuck.
